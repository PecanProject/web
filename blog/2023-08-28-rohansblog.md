## What is Google Summer of Code?

[Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a global program that pairs students with [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) organizations to produce code and contribute to these communities while making some money. The whole idea behind this program is to encourage students to get involved in open source contributions.

As part of the program, [organizations](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/) provide mentors to assist the student throughout the whole process, from learning about the community to contributing code

## About PEcAn

The Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) is an integrated ecological bioinformatics toolbox that consists of a scientific workflow system to manage the immense amounts of publicly available environmental data and a Bayesian data assimilation system to synthesize this information within state-of-the-art ecosystems models. It has

* An application program interface (API) that encapsulates an ecosystem model and provides a standard interface, inputs, and outputs.

* Core utilities for handling and tracking model run and the flows of information and uncertainties into and out of models and analyses.

* An accessible web-based user interface and visualization tools.

* An extensible collection of modules to handle specific types of analyses (sensitivity, uncertainty, ensemble), model-data syntheses (benchmarking, parameter data assimilation, state data assimilation), and data processing (model inputs and data constraints).

**The Project:**

GitHub Actions is a powerful tool that enables developers to automate their workflows and streamline their software development process. Our project aimed and successfully achieved the following goals:

* Optimized package version checks in GitHub Actions to limit the number of checks.

* Utilized the full Docker stack for testing SIPNET.

* Created a test that runs tests using the develop stack and writes the results to a file in a special branch.

* Updated the dashboard to fetch data from the special branch and display the results.

## Weekly Progress:

Week 1

* *Discussed with mentor the project goals*

* *Successfully created [first PR](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/pull/3176) and waiting for mentor/ community review*

## Wrapping Up

Google Summer of Code is an excellent opportunity for students to work on a project that matters while also significantly improving their coding skills and teamwork abilities.

Working on this GSoCâ€™23 project with PEcAn Project was an enjoyable experience. I want to express my gratitude to my mentor, [**Rob Kooper](https://github.com/robkooper)** for his constant support and guidance throughout this program. Thank you so much! Working with you was a really fantastic experience, and I look forward to work with you on more open source projects in the future!

Finally, thanks to the GSoC program for providing this wonderful opportunity to work in such a great open source community, I was able to work on such a large real-world project, and I learned a lot throughout this program. I can confidently say that my coding abilities have improved over the ten weeks of GSoC.
